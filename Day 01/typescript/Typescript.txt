TypeScript :
-It is super set of javascript.
-It is compile language.
-It is strict types language.

*how to know ts is available or not
*how to install TypeScript

npm i -g TypeScript // to install typescript

npx tsc -v // check typescript version

*how to execute typescript file

npx tsc fileNme.ts // compile ts file and create on plain js file
node fileName.js // to execute js file 

*variable declaration in ts
*datatype in ts
1.number
2.array
3.string
4.enum : It create variable with constant values
5.any : when we don't know what type of data is going to store in variable in that case we use it.
6.tupple : It allow us to store multiple type of data into array.
7.union : It allow us to store multiple values in single variable
8.boolean

task:write one parameterize function in ts which will take two parameter and dispaly your fullname.

task : w.a.parameterize function  which will rewritten are of circle passing radius values as parameter


OOPS :
1-class : -It is collection of data-member and member-function.
          -It i templete which we can re-use.
          -To create class we use class keyword.


*this : it refers to current class or object to access its data inside it only.

2.object : -It is an instance of class.
           -It allows us to access class data-member and member-function outside class.
syntax: let ObjectName = new ClassName();

Eg:
create object of class

 let personObj = new Person(102,"rahul","chennai");
 console.log(personObj.pname);
 personObj.personDetails();


*constructor :-It is special member function of class
              -It will execute automatically when class object get created or initialize
              -In ts constructor name must only be constructor.

3.Inheritance :
-accessing parent class property into child class
-to perform Inheritance in between classes we use extends keyword.

-super() :
-it represent parent class constructor inside child class constructor.
-super method must be first statement in child class constructor.


4.Encapsulation : 
-wrapping of data into single unit.

-public : we can access class property inside,outside class as well as in derived(child) class.
-protected : we can access class property inside same class as well as in derived(child) class.
-private : we can access class property inside same class only.

5.Polymorphism : It is ability to take more than one form.

-method overloading : when we have multiple method with same name in same class.
-method overriding : when we have multiple method with same name in different class.

6.abstraction : 
-hidding implementation and showing necessary information.
-we can can achieve this by using interface,abstract class,access modifiers(private,protected)


*module : 
-writing ts code in single or multiple file and access it in another file.
-to achieve this we use export and import keyword
-to send data we use export
-to acces it we use import

*interface : 
-it is signature of class.
-it contain abtract method.
-to create interface we use interface keyword.
-its child class has responsibilty to implement it.
-to implement interface we use implement keyword.
