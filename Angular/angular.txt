*Angular : 
-it is javascript framework.
-it provide desiging and development for creating single page application.
-latest version of angular is 18.
-Angular is developed and maintain by Google.

-software pre-requisit
-nodejs : node --version 
-ts : tsc -v
-angular : ng --version.

*how to create angular project
step1 : ng new projectName
step2 : cd projectName
step3 : ng serve or ng serve
step4 : go to browser  url and write localhost:4200

-angular work on component
-component : -it is partial part of angular project,
             -it contain code for angular project,
             -it can be any part of project,which we can reuse multiple time.
-in angular root component name is app.

*how to create component in angular
ng generate component componentName
or
ng g c componentName

-when we create component in angular it generate four fie
html,css,ts,spec.ts

ng g c databinding
ng g c directive

-how to get output of individual component
-go to component ts file and copy its selector name and write as tag where you want.

*databinding : getting or accessing data from one file to another file in same component.
1.interpolation {{}} : in this we send data from ts file to html file 
2.property binding[] : in this we set attribute(property) values ts to html
3.event binding () : in this we sent data from html to ts file
4.two-way databinding [()] = -in this we can send data from ts to html and html to ts file.
                             -to perform two-way databinding we have ngModel directory but ngModel directive is not part of core angular module it is part formsModule, for this first we have to import formsModule in component.ts file in import array.

task1 : create one component with name toggleimage in which on button click you have to toggle image.
task2 : create one component with name changeimage in which click on multiple button change images.

*directive in Angular
-it is use to change appearance and behaviour as well as perform DOM manipulation in angular.
-there are three types of directives in angular
1.structural directive : -it is use to perform dom manipulation in angular.
                         -structural directive denoted by *
                         -structural directives are *ngIf,*ngFor,*ngSwitchCase.
                         -we can apply one directive at a time to single element.
                         -it is part of common module ,for this first we have to import common in component.

    -ng-templete : display out on the basis of condition.
    -to create reference variable in angular we use #

2.attribute directive : it is use to change appearance and behavior of DOM
-ngStyle : it is use to apply style property on the basis of condition
-ngClass : it is use to apply css class on the basis of condition
-ngModel : it is use to perform two-way databinding.

3.custom directive : this directive created by developer ng g directive directivename.

*use of templete refferance variable

*component interaction : 
accessing data from parent component to child component.
-Input() decorator : it is use to send data from parent component to child component.
-output() decorator :  it is use to send data from child component to parent component.

*pipes : 
- it is use to transform property value without changing itd original value.
-it is denoted by | single
-there are three types of pipes in angular
    1. inbuilt pipes  : pipe created by developer
    2. custom pipes : pipe create by developer for particular use
    3. thirdparty pipes : pipes already developed by third party vendor , first we have to install it and then use it.


1.inbuilt pipe:
-string pipe
-json pipe
-number pipe
-currently pipe
-date pipe

2.custom pipe : 
ng generate pipe pipeName
npx ng generate pipe shared/custompipe/cube

ng g c mypipes

task: create one custom pipe with name sqauare which will return the square of any number.

*how to bootstrap in angular
step1 : npm i bootstrap
step2 : go to angular.json file and in its style array import its path
step3: restart angular project


layout folder
Nav,pagenotfound,maindashboard,footer,login
ng g c layout/Nav

froms folder
angform,utdf,rtf
ng g c forms/angform

*routing in Angular : 
-navigation of component
-to dispaly component output or navigating componently using routing in angular for it we write code in app.routes.ts.file
-

1.nameing routing
2.default routing
3.re-direct routing
4.parameterize routing
5.child routing
6.wild-card routing

*how to navigate in angular
-to perform component navigate we have to use routerLink property with anchore tag, but first we have to import RouterLink in component ts file from "@angular/router" library

*angular Form
-there are two types of forms
1.UTDF(User Templete Deriven Form) : 
    -when we have create simple form validation in that case we use it.
    -to perform validation we have to use ngModel directory with input element
    -in this ngForm directory will hold data of all input element in it.
    -in utdf from validation code reside in html file.

2.RTF(Reactive Templete From) :
    -when we to write complies logic to perform from validation in that case we use it.
    -to use rtf from validation first we have to import ReactieveFormModule from FormsModule in component.
    -in rtf we write form validation code in ts file.
    -in this we use mainly two classes 1.FormGroup 2.FormControl
    -FormGroup : it will hold information of all input element.
    -FormControl : it will hold information of individual input element.


*service in angular
-in angular service is special class with extra power.
-it is use for multiple uses
1.to share data with multiple component.
2.we can implement bussiness logic in it.
3.we can perfoman external communication(database connection)

*how to create service
ng g service serviceName

ng g service shared/service/itemsservice
ng g service shared/service/dbservice

*how to access data from service into angular component
-if you want to service data into angular for this firt we have import service in component ts file and create instance of service class.


*REST fake API
-CRUD

cd src/app/shared/database
json-server --watch -p 8888 db.json

*how to make API request from angular to server
-to send request from angular service to server for this we have create instance of httpClient
class in service ,but HttpClient class is not part of core angular it is part of HttpClientModule,

so first we have to import HttpClientModule module

npx ng g c crud/productdash
npx ng g c crud/productadd
npx ng g c crud/productedit

step1 : install it
npm i -g concurrently
step2 : go to package.json file and in script part wwrite below code


"json-server" : "cd src/app/shared/database && json-server - -watch -p 8888 db.json",
"start-dev" : "concurrently \"ng serve\"\"npm run json-server\"",

step3 : terminate all server and terminal
step4 : run => npm run start-dev


*guard : in angular guard is use to prevent rendering of routing component
        -it return boolean value either true or false
        -if it return true then component will render otherwise not


*how to generate guard
ng g guard guardname
ng g guard shared/custguard/auth


*how to create built file of angular project
ng build


step1 : install library
npm install -g angular-http-server
step2 : go dist folder path
step3 : write below command
        angular-http-server

H.W : implement logic for logout


*testing in angular

ng test

ng g service shared/services/mytestSer
